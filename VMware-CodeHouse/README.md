This is the repository containing all the curriculums created by graduate students @ VMware CodeHouse over 1.5 days.
The curriculums are developed under supervision and guidance pursuant to the CodeChix Technical Curriculums 
proprietary guidelines, design, format and processes.
The teams are judged on their curriculums by a team of top engineers and executives from VMware.

The curriculums are further reviewed by a select team of CodeChix senior women engineers from various
companies and feedback is collected and implemented.  Once the review and update process is complete,
CodeChix will open source all curriculums under the CodeChix Technical Curriculums policies.

The projects include the following teams:
